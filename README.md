# Movie Analytics Interactive Dashboard

Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for Python packages.

Quick start

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
python -m streamlit run "Movie Analytic Interactive Tool.py"
```

Notes

- Place `movies.csv` next to the app file.
- If the editor shows missing-import warnings, they are usually linter/Pylance issues; the app will run if packages are installed in the selected interpreter.
